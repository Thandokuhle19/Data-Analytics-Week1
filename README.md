# Data-Analytics-Week1
_What is data analytics?_
- Analytics is a process of converting raw data into usefull insights. So, virtually every organisation collects large quantites of data about its customers, products, employees, and service offering.
- Managers analyse the data and manage/control the information that contains that data to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and profitability.
- By converting this data, it involves several key responsibilities and skills, which are:
#        1. Data Collection and Preperation:
           - Source data from a variety of channels, like databases, spreadsheets, and external sources,
           - Cleaning and organising the data to ensure it is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.
#        2. Data Analysis:
           - Employing statistical methods, machine learning, or other analytic tool to interpret data.
#        3. Data Visualization and Storytelling:
           - Create visual representations of data, eg, charts, graphs, to make difficult information easily understandable.
           - Articulate findings in an attentive manner to communicate the significance of the data to stakeholders.
#         4. Decision Support:
            - Make recommendations based on data-driven insights to help guide business decisions,
            - Provide context around data.
#            5. Collaboartion and Communication:
               - Work closer with other departments, like marketing, finance, etc.
               - Always communicating complicated data findings in a clear and brief manner to non-technical stakeholders.
#               6. Continuous Learning and Adaption:
                 - Being up-to-date with the latest industry trends, tools, and technologies in data analysis.
                 - Adapt to new types of data and analytival methods as the organisation's needs evolve.
- When these roles are fulfilled, a data analyst helps an organisation make informed decisions that can improve operational efficiencies, drive business strategies, and creat a competitive advatange.
- Goal = contribute to the organisation's success by turning data into valuable asses that informs and drives decision-making.

# Careers in Analytics
- A supply-and-demand situations is presented as businesses try to keep up with these trends, by hiring managers finding themselves struggling to identify, recruit, and retain talented analytics professionals.
- This situations is problematic for businessess, however is good news for people seeking a job to break into the field.
- In the year 2020, Global State of Enterprise analytics survey, the firm MicroStatefy established that 94% of firms needed analytics to grow their businesses.
- Hence will inevitably lead to increased demand for hiring analytics professionals.
- Data analysts and scientists where ranked number 1 for the most demanding occupation in any career field.

# The Analytics Process
- Analysts work with data as they seek to gain business value from their orgranisation's data.
- They move through data in the following steps:
             1.  Data Acquistion
             2.  Cleaning and Manipulation
             3.  Analysis
             4.  Visualisation
             5.  Reporting and Communication

_The Analytics Process is Iterative:_
- The analytics process is more of a set of interrelated actions that may be revised frequently while working with a data set.
- Eg, when an analyst reviews a visualisation, they may notice unsual data points that may not seem to belong in the data set. This causes them to return to the data which cleans the stage and rerun their analysis with newly cleaned dataset.
- This process helps you to understand the different activites that take place during a data analysis effort and the approximate order which they occur.

_Analystis Techniques:_
- Analysts use various techniques to draw conclusions from the data at their disposal.
- These techniques are grouped into categories based on the purpose of the analysis to help understand the purpose of different types of analysis.
- The list below are the major categories of analytics techniques:
               1. Descriptive Analytics
               2. Predicitve Analytics
               3. Prescriptive Analytics

_Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning:_
- Analytics is intellectually and computationally demanding.
- That being said, you do not have to do the work by yourself but can rely from automated techniques to help unlock the hidden value on your data.
- To make informed decisions about the future we can use algorithms from the use of machine learning to discover knowledge in datasets.
- Machine learning hs applications across a wide variety of fields, here are some cases/examples where machine learning adds value:
           1. Divide customers and determine the marketing messages that attract different customer groups.
           2. Discover the irregularity in a system and applications that may be typical of a cybersecurity incident.
           3. Forecast product sales based on market and environmental conditions.
           4. To recommend the next movie that a customer might want to watch based on their watch history.
           5. Set price of the hotel rooms far in advance based on 
 forecast demand.
- As we move through the world, artificial intelligence(AI), machine learning, and deep learning are used interchangeably to describe techniques where computers are working with data.
- Artificial Intelligence(AI): type of technique where you attempt to get a computer system to imitate human behaviour.
- Machine Learning(ML): ML techniques attempt to apply statistics to data problems in an effort to discover new knowledge.
- Deep Learning: use complex techniques, like neral networks, to discover knowledge in a particular way. Most commonly used for image, video, and sound analysis.

# Data Governance
- Data governance programs ensure that the organisation has high-quality data and is able to effectively control that data.
- Without strong governance, analytics programs cannot function effectively.

_Analytics Tools:_
- Software help analysts work through each one of the phases of the analytics process.
- The tools automate heavy lifting of data analysis, improving the analysts's ability to acquire, clean, manipulate, visualise, and analyse data.
- They also provide invaluable assistance in reporting and communicating results.
- Some of the tools are well-known to most computer users like microsoft excel or google sheets.
- Others require more advanced skill, for example the R programming language which provides analysts with direct access to their data, which requires learning some basic coding skills.

 _Exploring Data Types:_
 - Data element: an attribute about a person, place, or thing containing data within a range of values.
 - They also describe characteristics of activities which include orders, transactions, and events.
 - Individual data types support structured, unstructured, semi-structured data.

_Tabular Data:_
- Tabular data: data organised into a table, made up of columns and rows.
- Table - represents information about a single topic.
- Each column - represents a unique named field within a table, also called a variable, about a single characteristic.
- Contents of each colimn contain values for the data the element as defined by the column header.
- We use practical tools which are spreadsheets that include microsoft excel, google sheets, and apple numbers for representing tabular data.
- The tabular model is extended by a relational database management system(RDMS), commonly called a database.
- Instead of having all data in a single table, a database organises related data across multiple tables.
- The connection between tables is known as a relationship.
- Some examples of database software are Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MQSL, and PostgreSQL.
- The concept that underpins both spreadsheets and relational data is called Tabular data.

_Structured Data Types:_
- Structured data is tabular in nature and organised into rows and columns.

_Character:_
- Character data type limits data entry to only valid characters.
- Characters can include alphabet that you might see on your keyboard, as well as numbers.
- Multiple data types are available that can enforce character limits, depending on your needs.
- The most widely used data type for storing character-based dat is Alphanumeric.
- Alphanumeric is appropriate when a data element consists of both numbers and letters.
- Alphanumeric data type is ideal for storing product stock-keeping units(SKUs).
- To exclude numbers you can use the text data type.
- We have stringent which is related alphanumeric data type, which allows the storage of alphabetic characters.
- Each database software has its unique method of implementing character data types to handle the nuances related to character data.
- Most signifance difference deal with how much data a particular data element can contain.
- Determine how long the longest-possible text value will be before defining a column as alphanumeric.
- Data types are implemented differently by software vendors. There are individual data types, like CLOB and LONGTEXT, which are vendor-specific.
- You also need to be aware of the absolute limits imposed by the datbase you are using.
- When configuring a given cell or range of cells in a spreadsheet as a text-only data types, there's more effort than when using a database.

_Character Sets:_
- Think about the character set being used to input and store data when you use a database.
- Database use character sets to map, or encode, data and store it digitally.
- ASCII encoding is based on the U.S. English alphabet.
- ASCII accommodates both uppe and lowercase English alphabet and numbers, mathematical operators, and symbols.
- Unicode Transformation Format-8(UTF-8), allows non-Latin characters to be input by a user and stored in a file or database.
- Individual characters may consume multiple bytes, impacting the length of a character string you can store in a character data type.


_Strong and Weak typing:_
- A database column defined as numeric, aceepts numerical values.
- If you attempt to enter characters into a numeric column, you will get an error.
- Weak typing loosely enforces data types hence spreadsheets use weak typing.
- This makes it easier for people to accomplish their work.
- Spreadsheets default to an "automatic" data type and accommodate any value.
- When a person specifies a data type, it is enforced compaed to a database.

_Unstructured Data Types:_
- Unstructed data: any type of data that does not fit neatly into the tabular model.
- Digital images, audio recordings, video recordings, and open-ended survey responses are examples of unstructed data.
- We use data types designed explicitly to capture and analyse unstructured data.

_Categories of Data:_

- We try to fit data into structured and unstructed categories.
- Semi-structured data: represents the space between structured spreadsheets and unstructured videos.
- When we map data attributes to data, there considerations regarding the actual values to be stored:

_Common Data Structures:_
- Data needs to be stored in a consistent manner, to facilitate analysis.
- Improved integration and interoperability between tools make it easier for analysts to be productive. Which result to several concepts to become standardized.

_Structured Data:_
- Tabular data is structured data, with values stored in a consistent defined manner, organised into columns and rows.
- Data is consistent when all entries in a column contain the same type value.
- Structured data makes summarization easy.
- You can perform summarization across groups.
- But, structured data does not translate directly to data quality.

_Unstructured Data:_
- Unstructured data: is qualitive, describing the characteristics of an event or an object.
- Examples of unstructured data include images, phrases, audio or video recordings, and descriptive text.
- Since the data is highly variable, the organisational and storage are different from the structured data.
- They represent a significant opportunity.
- Common source of unstructed data is machine data.
- Machine data has many sources, like Internet of Things devices (IoT), smartphones, tablets, personal computers, and servers.
- They create digital footprints of their activity.
- The data is unstructured and can identify machine-to-machine interaction.
- With unstructured data, the key is a unique identifier, whereas the value is the unstructured data itself.

_Semi-Structured Data:_
